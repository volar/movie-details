# Movies API
Build a REST API using ExpressJS to manage the movie details. The Node application should be able to read the data from a .json file as a REST resource.​

​Add new a movie, fetch all the movies, fetch a specific movie by id, delete a movie and update the details of a specific movie. ​


# Prioritizated list of what I want to see out of a job and in my career.

### Just a note 

1. <b>Financially secure</b> - I want to be able to support myself and my family without needing to be concerned about today or the future.
2. <b>Work/life balance</b> - I want to be able to step away from work and not have to be concerned (on-call is fine, but must be structured). 
  I want the flexibility to spend time with my wife and son playing sports, hiking, traveling, etc.
3. <b>FDoing the right thing</b> -  I do not want to do work that harms other people nor do I want to work on problems that are not actually in my employer's best interests.
4. <b>Good people</b> - I like working with good people who are curious and want things to be better than they are.
5. <b>Learning and improving</b> - I love learning and want to know more and also why pretty much every step of the way. I do not want to stagnate, I want to keep growing.
6. <b>Interesting problems</b> - I do want to be engaged in my work, and that usually seems to require problems that have not been solved within their context.
7. <b>Stability and agency</b> - I value the ability to trust that my position is sufficiently secure that the above priorities can be followed and that I can be allowed/enabled to follow them.
